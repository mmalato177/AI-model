# AI_Project
The goal of this project is to classify images using convolutional neural network-based models.

## Project Development
The project is structured in stages, including:


1. Data exploration and preprocessing.
2. Implementation of convolutional neural network models.
3. Training and evaluation of the models.
4. Analysis of the results.

## Requirements
The project must meet the following requirements:

- Training, validation, and test datasets must be used and properly described.
- RGB images (three channels) must be utilized.
- At least one model must be developed from scratch (referred to here as model S). At least one of these models must be different from the ones covered in class.
- At least two different optimizers must be explored.
- Model S must be trained both with and without data augmentation.
- Transfer learning models (referred to here as model T) must be developed using feature extraction and fine-tuning techniques.
- Model T must also be trained both with and without data augmentation
